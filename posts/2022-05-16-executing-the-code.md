This article covers simplified sequence of program execution. **...in progress**

Lets break down what happens when launch hello, world 

0. Start stb and type ```run```
1. Terminal laucnhes Sbt
2. Sbt uses Scalac to compile the code you wrote (Scala code) into Java Bytecode. In our case, compiler - is a program that converts Scala code (that you write in an editor) to Java Bytecode. Java bytecode are compiled Java sources that can be directly processed or executed by a Java virtual machine. 
3. Sbt uses Scala to ___
4. Scala uses JVM to execute Java Bytecode

Hence, sbt run means compilation -> running


As we found out in the previous section, 

Lets define terms:

**compilation** - transformation from source code (human readable) into machine code (computer executable). 


**run code** - is the process by which a computer or virtual machine reads and acts on the instructions of a computer program. In our case, such virtual machine is JVM. It understands instruction set.

**Java Virtual Machine** - 

***.scala** - 

***.class** - 



Javabyte code is stored in a file(s) with ".class" extension.
