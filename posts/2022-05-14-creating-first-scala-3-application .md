The article explains how to build "Hello, world" Scala 3 application. 

**Pre-requisites**
* entry-level programming knowledge
* macOS

If you are an experienced developer I`d recommend to start your learning with **[Scala 3 Book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html)**. 

## Step 1: Install development software 

#### Code editor
Install **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**. You may choose another editor: Sublime Text, Vim or Emacs. Each of them is lightweight and beloved by community. The other cool way of editing Scala code is using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html). Still, for fast immersion  to Scala, we will stick with VS Code. 


#### Extention for the  editor 
Install **[Metals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals)**.
This plugin enriches the editor with knowledge how to deal with Scala code and resources. As a result, the editor enhances your development experience. For instance, highlights syntax errors, autocompletes your code (kind of T9) and much more. If you do not install the extension, you still be able to write Scala applications but the  editor won`t know how to assist you.

#### Development environment

 Install a default set of applications and resources allowing Scala program to run. Just insert and run the following command in Terminal. 

```
curl -fL https://github.com/coursier/launchers/raw/master/cs-x86_64-apple-darwin.gz | gzip -d > cs && chmod +x cs && (xattr -d com.apple.quarantine cs || true) && ./cs setup
```
The command launches the application called Coursier which installs a bundle of apps. These apps consist typical Scala development environment. The list of the them can be found [here](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation). If you are looking for other ways to setup Scala development environment, e.g. using Brew, see  [Coursier documentation](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation). 

Lets check if the installation has been successful. Run scala -version in Terminal. Once it outputs Scala version and year, everything is fine
```
Scala code runner version 3.1.2 -- Copyright 2002-2022, LAMP/EPFL
```

Congrats! ü•≥ 
One of the coolest programming language is ready for exploitation

## Step 2: Create a project

"Create a project" implies generating a folder containing source files of your program. For this purpose, 
1. Create an empty folder on your computer manually. Feel free to name and locate it at your consideration.

2. Open the created folder with Terminal. You can do it either by tapping "New Terminal at Folder" or, in case you are familiar with Terminal, cd to the folder.

3. Run the following in Terminal: 
```
sbt new scala/scala3.g8
```
4. In a short while, Terminal will prompt you to name your project. Write ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù and press enter. 


## Step 3: Open the project with editor

1. Launch VS Code. 
2. Click "Open Folder" and select ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù directory. The directory is located in the project folder you created earlier
3. Once you`ve selected and clicked ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù, VS Code will start opening the project and ask you whether to import the build. Press ‚ÄúImport build‚Äù.




## Step 4: Run the code

1. pen Terminal in VS Code
2. Run command 
```
sbt
```
We have just started so-called "sbt server". Now it accepts (listens and executes) input from Terminal.

3. Run the command 
```
run
```
See the output

Your first Scala 3 application has been runned successfully ‚úÖ
Perfect üëç 

In the future, to run the code, you will always have to run sbt through the terminal, and then run the run command. This is because VS Code doesn't know much about Scala (unlike Intellij IDEA). Therefore, we use SBT as a coordinator (like a project manager in an office).
