title: Hacking on Dotty&#58; The Diary
description: Thought processes that can be used when working with large code bases
---

Recently I was working on the [solution](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/6023) to [this bug](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/5980) in the Dotty compiler. While doing so, I was also testing an approach inspired by the [Theory of Constraints](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theory_of_constraints) (see my previous blog posts about the models) when applied to working with large code bases.

The approach is all about maintaining the order in your head while being at an unknown location. So far, for me writing things down was one of the best ways to do so.

So I logged my journey â€“ from forking Dotty to hacking on it and making that bug go away. The log is an unedited dump from Evernote, so don't expect smooth flow of thought â€“ but maybe some will find it entertaining or even useful.
