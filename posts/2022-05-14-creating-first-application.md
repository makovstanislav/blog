description: step-by-step explanation of how to build your first Scala 3 application from scratch on macOS
---
The article explains how to build "Hello, world" application in Scala 3. 

#### Pre-requisites
* Entry-level programming knowledge
* macOS

If you are an experienced developer I'd recommend starting with **[Scala 3 Book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html)**. 

## Step 1: Install development software 
#### Code editor
Install **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**. You might choose another editor: Sublime Text, Vim or Emacs. Each of them is lightweight and beloved by the community. For immediate immersion in Scala, we will stick with VS Code. 

#### Extention for the  editor 
Install **[Metals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals)**.
This plugin teaches the editor to understand Scala code. As a result, the editor enhances your development experience. For instance, it highlights syntax errors, autocompletes code (kind of prompts on a phone keypad) or keeps indentation. Of course, if you do not install the extension, you still can write in Scala, but an editor won't know how to assist you.

#### Development environment
 Install a default set of applications needed for a Scala program to run. Just insert the following[^1] in the Terminal:

   ```
   curl -fL https://github.com/coursier/launchers/raw/master/cs-x86_64-apple-darwin.gz | gzip -d > cs && chmod +x cs && (xattr -d com.apple.quarantine cs || true) && ./cs setup
   ```

This command launches the application called Coursier that installs the required software. This software constitutes the basis of the Scala development environment. The list of them can be found **[here](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation)**. If you are looking for other ways to set up the Scala development environment, e.g. using Brew, see  [Coursier documentation](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation). 

Let's verify that the installation has been successful. Run `scala -version` in the terminal. If the installation was successful, you should see the Scala version in the output.
```
Scala code runner version 3.1.2 -- Copyright 2002-2022, LAMP/EPFL
```
If you do not receive similar output, please reboot your computer üíª

Perfect. One of the coolest programming languages is ready for use üëå

## Step 2: Create a project

"Create a project" implies generating a folder containing the source files of your program. For this purpose, 
1. Create an empty folder on your computer manually. Feel free to name and locate it at your discretion.

2. Open the created folder with the terminal. You can do it either by right-clicking on the folder and selecting "New Terminal at Folder", or, in case you are familiar with the terminal, `cd` to the folder.

3. Run the following in the terminal: ```sbt new scala/scala3.g8```
4. In a short while, the terminal will prompt you to name your project. Write ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù and press enter.

## Step 3: Open the project with the editor
1. Launch VS Code. 
2. Click "Open Folder" and select ‚Äúhello-world‚Äù directory. The directory is located in the project folder you created earlier
3. Once you've selected and clicked ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù, VS Code will start opening the project and will ask you whether to import the build. Press ‚ÄúImport build‚Äù.

## Step 4: Run the code

1. Open Terminal in VS Code
2. Run the `sbt` command. We have just started a so-called "sbt server". Now it is accepting (listening and  interpreting) input from the terminal.
3. Run the command ```run``` and see the output.

Perfect üëç  
Your first Scala 3 application has run successfully.

For running your program, you should always start sbt server once (by ```sbt``` command), and then type ```run``` command (for each running). This is because VS Code doesn't know how to handle Scala projects. So it is safe to say that Sbt acts as a coordinator of Scala development environment.
