The article explains how to build minimal Scala 3 application from scratch on macOS. 
The flow described here is regular and you may go through your own way to familirize yourself with Scala 3. The less experienced you are, the more it is recommended to stick to the guide below.
## What I`ve just done?

Lets debrief what we have for now

#### Build structure
The source files of our created project are now in the "hello-world" folder. It is called "base directory". Let's look at its structure:
IMANGE

The base directory is generated by Sbt by default template. Don`t hesitate to read [documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Directories.html) about base directory structure.

#### Installed apps

||What is it?|What does it do?|When and how to use it?|Read more|
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|**Metals**|	Extention for VS Code. Language server for Scala. |	Powers the editing experience by implementing autocomplete, error-checking (diagnostics), jump-to-definition, refactoring etc. Though it`s not IDE, it has some IDE features. Without it, VS Code would not know how to assist you	| Once you install the extension, VS Code automatically triggers it|		https://scalameta.org/metals/docs
|**Coursier**|Scala artifacts fetcher (or "dependency resolver")|installs applications and fetch other resources allowing Scala program to run| It is used by command line (CLI).|https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation|
|**Sbt** |build automation tool. In full form: "scala build tool"|*builds Scala project automatically *exploit various apps to run Scala code|There is no need to open it manually. Sbt launches JVM automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt.|https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html|
|**Scalac**|Scala compiler|converts Scala code into Java bytecode (readable by machine)|There is no need to open it manually. Sbt launches scalac automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt|https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/compiler-options/index.html|
|**JVM** |Java Virtual Machine. Not the Java programming language|Executes programs written in Scala language compiled into Java bytecode (readable by machine)|There is no need to open it manually. Sbt launches JVM automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt.|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine|
|**Adopt Open JDK**|Java development kit (it includes JVM, standard java libraries etc)|facilitates creation applications on Java platform|There is no need to open parts of JDK manually. Sbt launches them automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit|
|**Scalafmt**|Scala code formatter|keeps formatting (indentation, line breaks etc) compatible to conventions|Metals automatically triggers Scalafmt|https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/|
|**scala**| Scala REPL and script runner| Evaluates expressions written in Scala |	By CLI when you want to run (e.g. test) easily some script without the overhead of setting up a project. "Playground area"| https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html |
|**Ammonite**|	Enhanced Scala REPL and script runner	| Evaluates expressions written in Scala |	By CLI when you want to run (e.g. test) easily some script without the overhead of setting up a project. "Playground area"	|https://ammonite.io|
