This article breaks down typical Scala development environment 

In the previous section we have installed the following applications

||What is it?|What does it do?|When and how to use it?|
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|**Metals**|	Extention for VS Code. Language server for Scala. |	Powers the editing experience by implementing autocomplete, error-checking (diagnostics), jump-to-definition, refactoring etc. Though it`s not IDE, it has some IDE features. Without it, VS Code would not know how to assist you	| Once you install the extension, VS Code automatically triggers it|
|**Coursier**|Scala artifacts fetcher (or "dependency resolver")|installs applications and fetch other resources allowing Scala program to run| It is used by command line (CLI).|
|**Sbt** |build automation tool. In full form: "scala build tool"|*builds Scala project automatically *exploit various apps to run Scala code|There is no need to open it manually. Sbt launches JVM automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt.|
|**Scalac**|Scala compiler|converts Scala code into Java bytecode (readable by machine)|There is no need to open it manually. Sbt launches scalac automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt|https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/compiler-options/index.html|
|**JVM** |Java Virtual Machine. Not the Java programming language|Executes programs written in Scala language compiled into Java bytecode (readable by machine)|There is no need to open it manually. Sbt launches JVM automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt.|
|**Adopt Open JDK**|Java development kit (it includes JVM, standard java libraries etc)|facilitates creation applications on Java platform|There is no need to open parts of JDK manually. Sbt launches them automatically (under the hood) when you run your Scala program by sbt|
|**Scalafmt**|Scala code formatter|keeps formatting (indentation, line breaks etc) compatible to conventions|Metals automatically triggers Scalafmt|
|**scala**| Scala REPL and script runner| Evaluates expressions written in Scala |	By CLI when you want to run (e.g. test) easily some script without the overhead of setting up a project. "Playground area"| 
|**Ammonite**|	Enhanced Scala REPL and script runner	| Evaluates expressions written in Scala |	By CLI when you want to run (e.g. test) easily some script without the overhead of setting up a project. "Playground area"	|

## Build structure
The source files of our created project are now in the "hello-world" folder. It is called "base directory". Let's look at its structure:
IMANGE

The base directory is generated by Sbt by default template. Don`t hesitate to read [documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Directories.html) about base directory structure.
